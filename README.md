# Fortran Project Template

Modern Fortran development made simple - an opinionated, batteries-included project template that brings contemporary development practices to Fortran projects.

## Why This Template?

Fortran remains a crucial language in scientific computing, engineering, and high-performance computing. However, while the language has modernized significantly, the development workflow often lags behind contemporary software engineering practices. This template bridges that gap by providing:

- modern development features like code completion, automated testing, and documentation generation out of the box.
- seamless integration of Fortran codebases with modern DevOps practices, including continuous integration, code quality checks, and automated documentation.
- IDE-like tooling integration with VS Code and extensions.

### Key Benefits

- 🚀 **Instant Modern Setup**: Get a fully configured development environment in minutes, not days
- 🔍 **Code Intelligence**: Real-time error detection, code completion, and refactoring support via VS Code integration
- 📊 **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing, formatting, and linting integrated with git workflow
- 📚 **Automated Documentation**: Generate professional documentation from your code comments
- 🛠️ **Best Practices Built-in**: Pre-configured tools enforce consistent code style and quality
- 🔄 **Modern Workflow**: Brings git-based workflow, dependency management, and automated builds to Fortran

### Traditional vs Modern Fortran Development

| Aspect | Traditional Approach | With This Template |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Setup Time | Hours/days configuring tools | Minutes with pre-configured environment |
| Error Detection | At compile time | Real-time as you type |
| Code Style | Manual enforcement | Automated formatting and checks |
| Documentation | Manual maintenance | Generated from code comments |
| Testing | Often manual or ad-hoc | Automated with each commit |
| Dependencies | Manual management | Handled by package manager |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Linux OS or WSL2 via Windows
- GFortran or oneAPI Fortran compiler

#### Optional

- VS Code installation
- Modern Fortran extension installation

### Step-by-step instructions

0. Load compiler modules (if on a compute cluster):

    ```sh
    module load gcc
    # or
    module load intel
    ```

1. Create and activate a Python environment:

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Remember to activate your enviroment before runtime or development tasks.

2. Install the runtime and development packages:

    ```sh
    pip3 install .  # Install runtime dependencies from pyproject.toml
    pip3 install .[dev]  # Install development dependencies
    ```

3. Run the tests and main program:

    ```sh
    fpm test  # by default it uses gcc/gfortran to compile and run
    fpm run
    ```

4. Migrate your project:

    See a step-by-step guide on how to [migrate your project](./docs/MIGRATION.md).

## Code Quality

This template integrates several tools to maintain high code quality:

### IDE Integration

- Real-time error detection and linting via the Modern Fortran extension and `fortls` language server
- Intelligent code completion and navigation
- Code formatting with `fprettify` for consistent style

### Automated Checks

- Pre-commit hooks run tests and quality checks before git commit and push
- Automated testing with `fpm test`
- Compile-time checks with `fpm build` (debug/release modes)

For detailed configuration and usage instructions, see [TOOLING.md](./docs/TOOLING.md).

## Documentation

Automated documentation is generated by using the [ford](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford) package. For example config files and usage, see [here](https://forddocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

To generate dcoumentation for this sample project, and then view it on the browser, run:

```sh
ford ford.md
firefox docs/ford/index.html  # Alternatively, use your preferred browser
```

## Development Tools

The template includes preconfigured development tools and settings for Modern Fortran development, with optimized configurations for:

- VS Code integration
- Language server features
- Code formatting
- Automated testing
- Package management

For detailed setup instructions and tool configurations, see [TOOLING.md](./docs/TOOLING.md).
